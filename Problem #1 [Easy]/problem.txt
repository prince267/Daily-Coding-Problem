Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: True
Explanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

nums = [1,3,1,5,4], k = 0
Output: True
Explanation: There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).
